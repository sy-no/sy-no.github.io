The file robots.txt is placed in the website's root folder and tells web robots, like search engine robot how to crawl pages on the website.

Using robots.txt allows one to exclude certain pages from the search engine robots if necessary, but robots.txt is by no means a security measure since nefarious robots will simply ignore robots.txt when crawling the website.
