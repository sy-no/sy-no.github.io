I think static site generators (SSG) are great for quickly and easily creating a responsive and well-designed website. 

Being able to use Markdown instead of HTML is a relief and a real time-saver. 

Being able to have the webpage split up into different logical files like head, header, footer, navigation etc. and then having the SSG compile all the files into one webpage is great. One doesn't have to repeat things like the navigation menu on every single page, and if you make a change you don't have to go through every page to replicate the change.

SSGs are good for simple websites or blogs that don't need a backend server to handle functionality.
