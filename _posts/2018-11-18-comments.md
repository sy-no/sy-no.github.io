I implemented comments on this website by using Disqus.

I created an account with Disqus and then used there getting started guide to generate the necessary code for adding comments to the posts.

I also enable emojis just for fun.

I saved the Disqus code in a separate file in the _include folder and then used include to add the file to the blog page.
