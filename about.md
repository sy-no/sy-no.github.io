Hi, my name is Sylvester Norrbjörk. I am born in Dalarna, Sweden. I am 38 years old and work
as a network administrator in Lecce, Italy. 

I have had an interest for programming for a long time, but circumstances took me on a different
path. I studied network and server administration and have been working in that field on and off 
for a while now.

I have also done a few amateur websites because I also had graphical design interests for a while
but making those websites made me realize that I actually like what's going on behind each web page
and on the server side. The DevOp programme that I am studying seems like a perfect balance between
what I do and what I want to learn to do.

I believe that it is seldom too late to start learning a new skill, especially if it´s something 
that you like to do. If you really like something you are also motivated to keep on doing it even
when it gets hard. 

Since I am now also working while studying I know that it is going to be really tough at times, 
but I hope that I will have the mental strength to pull through and achieve my goals.
